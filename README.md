# TExTBomber

This open-source repository contains a web app to send a high volume of SMS/MMS messages to a targeted phone number. The benefit of such a web app is highly underrated since the sending of messages is automated, thereby giving you the freedom to be free and to do actual business.

## How do I run the TExTBomber?

Follow these simple steps to get started,
1. Upload the files to a PHP server with an email server on it.
2. Go to the URL in your browser of where your files are stored.
3. You are now ready to go, just fill in the form and click Send Messages.

## Design

I was going for a friendly and straightforward interface, which a person with no previous knowledge can understand. When I came across this [API Explorer](https://github.com/nmfrankel/TExTBomber/blob/main/developer.squareup.com.jpeg?raw=true) from square payments, I knew it fit the build for this project.
