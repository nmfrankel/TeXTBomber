# TeXTBomber

This open-source repository contains a web app to send a high volume of SMS/MMS messages to a targeted phone number. The benefit of such a web app is highly underrated since the sending of messages is automated, thereby giving you the freedom to do whatever you want.

## How do I run the TeXTBomber?

Follow these simple steps to get started,
1. Upload the files to a PHP server with an email server on it.
2. Go to the URL in your browser of where your files are stored.
3. You are ready to go running, now fill in the form and click __Send Messages__.


## Use cases

- A friend challenges you to send him 500 "Happy Birthday" texts ðŸ¤£.
- A pal starts bombarding you with spam texts out of the blue. When asked to stop, he continues and does not listen ðŸ˜Ÿ.
- Any similar case to the previously mentioned cases.

Regardless of your case, you __MUST__ have consent from the recipient of the messages. By not doing so, the user is violating the terms of the license under which this project is public.

## Disclaimer

Please use this web app wisely, only when fully sober; the project is __NOT__ to be used to harm anyone in any way. Additionally, the "Bomber" in the project name is used only as a metaphor for the uncontrollable high volume of messages on the receiver's end.

## Limitations



## Design

I was going for a friendly and straightforward interface, which a person with no previous knowledge can understand. When I came across this [API Explorer](https://github.com/nmfrankel/TeXTBomber/blob/main/developer.squareup.com.jpeg?raw=true) from square payments, I knew it fit the build for this project.
