# TExTBomber

This open-source repository contains a web app to send a high volume of SMS/MMS messages to a targeted phone number. The benefit of such a web app is highly underrated since the sending of messages is automated, thereby giving you the freedom to do the business you want to do.

## Disclaimer

Please use this web app wisely, only when fully sober; the project is __NOT__ to be used to harm anyone in any way. Additionally, the "Bomber" in the project name is used only as a metaphor for the uncontrollable high volume of messages on the receiver's end.

## How do I run the TExTBomber?

Follow these simple steps to get started,
1. Upload the files to a PHP server with an email server on it.
2. Go to the URL in your browser of where your files are stored.
3. You are ready to go running, now fill in the form and click __Send Messages__.

## Design

I was going for a friendly and straightforward interface, which a person with no previous knowledge can understand. When I came across this [API Explorer](https://github.com/nmfrankel/TExTBomber/blob/main/developer.squareup.com.jpeg?raw=true) from square payments, I knew it fit the build for this project.
